**Project Overview: Quantum Optimization of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**

**Introduction**

The Western Quantum Computing Club (WQC) is developing an innovative quantum algorithm to optimize the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a significant challenge in logistics and supply chain management. Leveraging quantum computing's unique capabilities, our solution aims to identify the most efficient routes for distributors, minimizing fuel costs and reducing delivery times despite fluctuating daily conditions.

**Problem Statement**

Traditional VRP solutions, while effective, often struggle to adapt in real-time to changes such as traffic patterns, delivery deadlines, and fuel costs. These challenges frequently result in inefficiencies that drive up operational costs and reduce customer satisfaction. By harnessing quantum computing, we aim to significantly enhance route optimization, allowing companies to dynamically adapt to real-world changes.

**Project Objectives**

Quantum Algorithm Development
Develop a quantum algorithm that surpasses classical methods in both computational efficiency and adaptability, providing near-instantaneous solutions to complex routing challenges.

Full-Stack Application
Create an intuitive, user-friendly application enabling distributors to input routing parameters and receive optimized routes based on real-time data.

Cost and Time Optimization
Demonstrate the algorithm’s capability to reduce fuel costs and improve delivery times, delivering measurable savings and operational improvements.

**Solution Approach**

Quantum Computing
Utilizing combinatorial optimization algorithms, our quantum approach aims to provide a computational advantage over traditional methods.

Real-Time Adaptability
The application will combine historical and live data to adapt routing recommendations dynamically, accounting for variables such as traffic, weather, and delivery windows.

Scalability
Designed for scalability across various distribution networks, from local deliveries to complex, multi-regional operations.
